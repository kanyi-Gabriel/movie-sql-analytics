# 🎬 Movie Database SQL Exploration

This project explores a movie database using **SQL** to answer a series of real-world queries related to movies, actors, genres, awards, and production data. The goal is answer questions related to SQL database by filtering, aggregation, joins, string manipulation, and subqueries.

The SQLite Database used for this purpose is loaded together with the project file

## Getting Started (Requirements to run the project on Jupyter Notebook)

##### Beginner-Friendly MySQL Setup in Jupyter Notebook
This guide helps you set up a connection to a local MySQL database using Jupyter Notebook. You’ll be able to test the connection and confirm everything is working by viewing a table.


#####  Step 1: Install Required Packages

**Run this code block in a Jupyter Notebook cell:**

      - !pip install ipython-sql==0.4.1
      - !pip install pymysql
      - !pip install mysql-connector-python
      - !pip install cryptography
      - !pip install prettytable==0.7.2
      - !pip install SQLAlchemy==1.4.49

👉 Once the installation is done, it's a good idea to restart the kernel before continuing. This ensures all packages load properly.
