## Getting Started (Requirements to run the project on Jupyter Notebook)

##### Beginner-Friendly MySQL Setup in Jupyter Notebook
This guide helps you set up a connection to a local MySQL database using Jupyter Notebook. You’ll be able to test the connection and confirm everything is working by viewing a table.


#####  Step 1: Install Required Packages

**Run this code block in a Jupyter Notebook cell:**

      - !pip install ipython-sql==0.4.1
      - !pip install pymysql
      - !pip install mysql-connector-python
      - !pip install cryptography
      - !pip install prettytable==0.7.2
      - !pip install SQLAlchemy==1.4.49

 Once the installation is done, it's a good idea to restart the kernel before continuing. This ensures all packages load properly.
